## Research interests

I work in the field of dynamical systems. Most of my research is focussed on the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems, particularly the use of functional analytic techniques to investigate these properties and understanding these properties for continuous time dynamical systems.
See my [research articles](publications/).

Since 2023 I've been working in the formalization of mathematics using the [Lean Theorem Prover](https://lean-lang.org/) and its [mathematical library](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).

## Position

I'm an associate professor in the [mathematics department](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/) of the University of Rome Tor Vergata (in the [mathematical physics](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~ricerca/fismat/area.php) group).

- I am a member of the editorial board of the [Journal of Dynamical and Control Systems](https://www.springer.com/journal/10883/).
- Abilitazione Scientifica Nazionale (Italy):
  - 2020: received the abilitazione for associate professor (01/A4 Mathematical physics - Seconda Fascia 2, 09/11/2020 – 09/11/2029)
  - 2025: received the abilitazione for full professor (01/A4 Mathematical physics - Prima Fascia 1, 07/03/2025 – 07/03/2037)

## Mini-biography

I received my PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of [Stefano Luzzatto](https://stefanoluzzatto.net/). I was a postdoc at UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro under the supervision of Vítor Araújo. Following that I was a postdoc member of the MALADY team at Roma II, Tor Vergata under the supervision of [Carlangelo Liverani](http://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~liverani/).

I was a postdoc at the University of Vienna under the supervision of Henk Bruin. Following that I was a FWF Lise Meitner postdoc at the University of Vienna, project leader of “Statistical Properties of Physical Chaotic Flows” and a member of the Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems group.

I was a postdoc in the [Mathematics section of ICTP](http://www.ictp.it/research/math).
Then I was a ricercatore (RTD-B) in the mathematics department of Roma II (Tor Vergata).
